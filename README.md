### This repository contains all the data science projects that I have worked on for academic and self learning purposes
1. Health Insurance Cost Prediction - The cost is predicted using multivariate linear regression with stochastic gradient descent, batch gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent
2. Job Offer Acceptance Prediction - Various feature selection methods were used and predictions were made using Logistic Regression Model
